Outline for Backyard Flyer

* Simulator Exploration - first, you will become familiar with the drone simulator you'll be using throughout this program.

* Flight Computer Programming - you'll review the roles of a drone's flight computer and autopilot so you understand how the flight computer code you'll be writing actually communicates with the drone's low-level autopilot.

* Event Driven Programming - you'll explore the concepts underlying event driven programming by reading and then modifying Python code for an EventDrivenChatBot class.

* A Simple Flight Plan - you'll see what event-driven programming looks like in the context of a real (but simple) flight plan.

* Phases of Flight - you'll learn how we represent the "lifecycle" of a flight plan with a finite state machine.

* Backyard Flyer - At the end of this lesson you'll actually implement your own flight plan within the event-driven programming paradigm you've been learning about.
